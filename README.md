# Digit Recognizer - Kaggle Problem - https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer
Created a multi-layered convolutional neural network to recognize and identify digits in images, solving a Kaggle problem.

I used the training data set provided by Kaggle to train my network, which resulted in a 97.5% success rate on recognizing digits in the testing data set.

Note: All files used are presented in this github directory, except for the training data and testing data CSV files since they are too large, but they can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer .
